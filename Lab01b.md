## **What is the Growth Mindset?**

The growth mindset to me is the ability to see a problem in different ways/perspectives. It's the ability to persevere when things start to get hard. It's basically a can do attitude. By contrast a Fixed Mindset is the opposite. It's inflexable, it's a can't do attitude. A view of life that is black or white instead of shades of grey. 

## **3 ways to keep myself in a growth mindset**

- I like what Steve Haffenden from our reading says 

>"...I try to recognize that avoidance, take a step back, and think about the growth mindset. When I’m ready, I walk through the problem once again, bit by bit, looking for new ways to think about it until I start to see another way forward. And for me, it always helps to talk through these steps – out loud, not just in my head.".

***So my plan is to recognize when I'm avoiding something*** I need to work on by being easily distractable. In additon to that, paying attention to when I see the work of others as a threat or something that makes me feel bad about my own work.

- ***Reflect at the end of my day*** on what was the best part, what didn't go well and how I can make sure what didn't go well goes better the next time.

- ***Take note of when I'm in the growth mindset*** and the flow of things. To notice that it feels good and that I'm capable of not constantly being in a Fixed Mindset.
