Wireframe/Wireframing

Basically a Wireframe is a barebones outline of the most important parts of my app, site or program. Wireframing is the process from the begining where I use pen and paper to create a sketch all the way to where I have a working prototype. 

After I do a Wireframe by hand the next step would be to use a site like Wireframe.cc.
Important stuff to think about is where the person looking at my site's attention will be drawn to first when they see my site. Also important to follow some common conventions when placing important like logos, login, etc.

1. Clarity
2. Confidence 
3. Simplicity is key
