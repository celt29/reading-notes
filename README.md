# About me

I'm originally from northern California, about 60 miles north of San Francisco. Currently I'm living in Seattle, WA and I've been here for 3 years now! 

I got involved in the PEV (personal electric vehicle) scene not long after I moved here. I started out with electric skateboards and then moved on to electric unicycles. Being a part of that community really helped me make a lot of friends and get to know the Seattle. 

I do Uber Eats for work on my electric unicycles and have been for nearly aslong as I've been here. I enjoy doing food delivery but I'm looking to transition into a career that is better suited for the longer term. I've always played around with computers ever since I got my first Dell laptop with Windows XP years ago although I never did really get into coding. Being in the Seattle and having a fair amount of my friends working in the tech sector, I figured I'd see what it was all about!

*What is the Growth Mindset?*

The growth mindset to me is the ability to see a problem in different ways/perspectives. It's the ability to persevere when things start to get hard. It's basically a can do attitude. By contrast a Fixed Mindset is the opposite. It's inflexable, it's a can't do attitude. A view of life that is black or white instead of shades of grey. 

***3 ways to keep myself in a growth mindset***

- I like what Steve Haffenden from out reading says *"...I try to recognize that avoidance, take a step back, and think about the growth mindset. When I’m ready, I walk through the problem once again, bit by bit, looking for new ways to think about it until I start to see another way forward. And for me, it always helps to talk through these steps – out loud, not just in my head."*. So my plan is to recognize when I'm avoiding something I need to work on by being easily distractable. In additon to that, paying attention to when I see the work of others as a threat or something that makes me feel bad about my own work.

- Reflect at the end of my day on what was the best part, what didn't go well and how I can make sure what didn't go well goes better the next time.

- Take note of when I'm in the growth mindset and the flow of things. To notice that it feels good and that I'm capable of not constantly being in a Fixed Mindset.
