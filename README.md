# About me

I'm originally from northern California, about 60 miles north of San Francisco. Currently I'm living in Seattle, WA and I've been here for 3 years now! 

I got involved in the PEV (personal electric vehicle) scene not long after I moved here. I started out with electric skateboards and then moved on to electric unicycles. Being a part of that community really helped me make a lot of friends and get to know the Seattle. 

I do Uber Eats for work on my electric unicycles and have been for nearly aslong as I've been here. I enjoy doing food delivery but I'm looking to transition into a career that is better suited for the longer term. I've always played around with computers ever since I got my first Dell laptop with Windows XP years ago although I never did really get into coding. Being in the Seattle and having a fair amount of my friends working in the tech sector, I figured I'd see what it was all about!
