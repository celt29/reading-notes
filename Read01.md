# Markdown

Markdown is essentially a way to make content for the web without having to learn a programming language. It's designed to be simple and be more like how you would write normally in your day to day. It does have some special characters but it's significantly less complicated to learn and use compared to something like HTML.

- **Headings:**  
Use a space infront of the text followed by # symbols (# like this) numbering from 1 # to 6 #'s, with 1 being the largest.
- **Paragraphs:**  
To create a Paragraph, seperate lines of text by using a blank line inbetween.
- **Line Breaks:**
To create a linebreak, use 2 white spaces after the last word or letter. Then begin on the line under and it will be a new seperate line.
- **Emphasis:**  
  - **Bold:**  
  To make text or any other character Bold you do 2 asteriks before and after (** **).
  - *Italic:*  
  To do Italic is just like Bolt but with 1 asterik (* *).
  - ***Bold and Italic:***  
  To do Bold and Italic at the sametime you do 3 asteriks before and after (*** ***). 
- Blockquotes:  
  - Single Paragraph:  
  You do an > plus a space ( ) then begin typing whatever you want the BQ to be.  
  - Multiple Paragraphs:  
  To do a multi Paragraph BQ you do the same as for a single BQ but you add an > on each blank line between Paragraphs. For the 2nd or 3rd and so on paragraph you just do the > as normal.
  - Nested paragraphs:  
  You can nest a BQ by doing 2 >>'s infront of the paragraph you want to nest.
  - BQ's can contain most MD formated elements but not all. You have to experiment. 
  - BQ best practice is to put a blank line before and after.
- Lists
  - Unordered list:  
  In order to do an UL you simply add a - with a space ( ) after it and then add w/e you want to the list. An example would be (- ). If you want to start an UL with a number followed by a period you need to "escape" the (.) with a (\) before it, otherwise it will become an OL.
  - Ordered list:  
  To do an OL you start with the number 1 add a period (1.) and then when you want to go to the next list item you just start on a new line and do the number 2 with a period (2.) and so on.
  - Adding elements in Lists:  
  To add another element in a list while preserving the continuity of the list, indent the element four spaces or one tab, as shown in the following examples. Reference the Basic Syntax reading.
  You can nest an UL in an OL, indent 4 spaces. 
  
- Code  
To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in backticks (` `).
To escape backticks you may already have inplace of single or double quotes you do this (` `).
- Horizontal Rules  
Do three dashes (---) on a line by themselves.
- Links
[name](website link)
Quickly turn URL or email into a link enclose the link in < >.
Formating links add asterisks before and after the brackets and parens. For code, add backticks inside the brackets.
