# Markdown

Markdown is essentially a way to make content for the web without having to learn a programming language. It's designed to be simple and be more like how you would write normally in your day to day. It does have some special characters but it's significantly less complicated to learn and use compared to something like HTML.

- **Headings:**  
Use a space infront of the text followed by # symbols (# like this) numbering from 1 # to 6 #'s, with 1 being the largest.
- **Paragraphs:**  
To create a Paragraph, seperate lines of text by using a blank line inbetween.
- **Line Breaks:**
To create a linebreak, use 2 white spaces after the last word or letter. Then begin on the line under and it will be a new seperate line.
- **Emphasis:**  
  - **Bold:**  
  To make text or any other character Bold you do 2 asteriks before and after (** **).
  - *Italic:*  
  To do Italic is just like Bolt but with 1 asterik (* *).
  - ***Bold and Italic:***  
  To do Bold and Italic at the sametime you do 3 asteriks before and after (*** ***). 
- Blockquotes:  
  - Single Paragraph:  
  You do an > plus a space ( ) then begin typing whatever you want the BQ to be.  
  - Multiple Paragraphs:  
  To do a multi Paragraph BQ you do the same as for a single BQ but you add an > on each blank line between Paragraphs. For the 2nd or 3rd and so on paragraph you just do the > as normal.
  - Nested paragraphs:  
  You can nest a BQ by doing 2 >>'s infront of the paragraph you want to nest.
  - BQ's can contain most MD formated elements but not all.
  - BQ best practice is to put a blank line before and after.
