## Command line notes

Command -> command line argument (The first is called an option, usually starts with a dash) -> command line arguments.

**Shortcut**: Use the arrow keys to go through already typed commands. Use side arrows to customize them.

pwd: print working directory  
ls: list. Can be used not just by itself.  
Cd: Change directory. Cd by itself brings back to home directory (but not root directory?). Usually done with one CLA.
Cd .. : Go up one level in the file tree.  
~: Shortcut for the home directory. Can use it instead of writing out the path.  
. : Refers to my current directory. More on it later.  
.. : Refers to the directory up one level aka parent directory.  

## Paths
**Absolute**: Specifies a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory. Always begins with a (/)  
**Relative**: Specifies a location (file or directory) in relation to where I am currently are in the system. Doesn't begin with a (/).  


## Choosing a text editor
There are a bunch of different text editors. All computers come with some sort of one. Mostly they're bare bones and not as well suited as 3rd party ones. 3rd party code specific editors come with handy features that make code writting more efficient. They're updated a lot with newer features but mostly when it comes down to it, selecting one is mostly personal preference.
