## Choosing a text editor
There are a bunch of different text editors. All computers come with some sort of one. Mostly they're bare bones and not as well suited as 3rd party ones. 3rd party code specific editors come with handy features that make code writting more efficient. They're updated a lot with newer features but mostly when it comes down to it, selecting one is mostly personal preference.
